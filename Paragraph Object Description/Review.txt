IDEAL

Ideally our users would be able sign into their laptops and then automatically have access to all of the applications they need to use.

REALITY

In reality we use at least three applications every day to accomplish our work. Each application is protected by a password with different requirements for username & password length. Passwords also expire at different times.

CONSEQUENCES

Users waste approximately 2 minutes per day logging into multiple applications (500 users * 2 minutes per day = 1000 minutes in lost productivity; 1000 minutes = 16.67 hrs per day * $75/hr = $1250 per day).
Helpdesk resolves approximately 6000 calls per year to reset forgotten passwords & unlock accounts.
Security risk as users will continue to write usernames & passwords on sticky notes at their desks.
PROPOSAL

Have S/W Dev, Network Administration and business stakeholders collaborate to evaluate potential solutions for a Single Sign On capability.
